# Minikube Presentation

I held a presentation on the Kubernetes GÃ¶teborg ([Cloud Native Nordics](https://www.cloudnativenordics.com/))<br>
meetup that was generously hosted by Meltwater, Wed December 4th, 2019.

<https://www.meetup.com/Kubernetes-Goteborg/events/265686037/>

The theme of the evening was Local Kubernetes, and I presented Minikube<br>
and some Machine history and upcoming features like KIC and Multinode.

There were also presentations of KIND and of k3s (running with Multipass)<br>
A very nice evening, and the three projects had lots of things in common.

Unfortunately, the video recording equipment did not want to cooperate...

## Related Projects

As was mentioned in the presentation, Minikube runs Kubernetes.

Another way to install Kubernetes is to use Vagrant and Ansible:

This is the most basic flavour of k8s, using Ubuntu and Docker.

Also mentioned in the presentation, k3s is similar to localkube:

<https://github.com/afbjorklund/docker-machine-minikube-install>

But it supports newer Kubernetes versions, and is even smaller!

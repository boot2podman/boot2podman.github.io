# Tiny Core Linux 12.0 Alpha

A pre-release version of Tiny Core 12.0 was announced on the [tinycore forum](http://forum.tinycorelinux.net/index.php/board,33.0.html), Alpha 1.

This will bring a new kernel (5.4.x --> 5.10.x) and a new compiler (gcc 9.2.0--> gcc 10.2.0)

Upgrading the golang compiler add-on (still need to patch ssl), new version will be go1.15

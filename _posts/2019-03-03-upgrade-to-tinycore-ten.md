# Upgrade to Tiny Core Linux 10.0

Work is under way to upgrade boot2podman to the new release of [tinycore](http://www.tinycorelinux.net/), 10.0-x86_64.

This will bring a new kernel (4.14.x --> 4.19.x) and a new compiler (gcc 7.2.0--> gcc 8.2.0)

We will also upgrade the Go compiler version, from current go1.10 to the new [go1.12](https://blog.golang.org/go1.12)...
